<h1>UNBLOCK3R</h1>
This uses the property that many text servers can only handle so many characters. This exploit adds "#" and then a very very long string of letters, successfully crashing the server while not changing the functionality of the page. It is with a similar concept as the among us exploit, however, this one is more practical.<br>
The bookmarklet (new_ui.js) can be executed on any site. However, it has less functionality than the HTML file. <br>
The HTML file (index.html) can be downloaded and then opened, or opened using the link in link.txt. It also contains other exploits for users to have more choice over how they want to disable filters. <br>
NOTE: This may not work with some blockers because they can handle more letters. <br>
This has minor glitches with certain sites, such as Pokemon Showdown, as they read the letters after the "#". Also, it creates lag when opening ChatGPT. However, this is fine, since it just displays a warning message. <br>
<br>If you think the current bookmarklet UI is bad, I'm building UI 3.0 rn. <br>
